    ROUNDS must satisfy k = T / 3 where T % 3 = 0, where k is 
    the iterations per each chaotic map. 

    To avoid brute force attacks, ROUNDS must also satisfy the 
    condition: pow([5 x pow(10, c - 1) - 1], ROUNDS) > pow(2, 256),
    where c is the number of digits in the seed.

    Note: The paper says that "In any cryptosystem, for poor keys 
    or limited key space K, the cryptosystem can be easily broken. 
    
    Indeed, given todayâ€™s computer speed, it is generally accepted 
    that a key space of size smaller than 2^128."

    However, the paper was written in 2014, and computing power has
    increased even more since then, so instead of 128, 256 is used 
    above as well as the following formula used to calculate k:
      floor(256 / log2(5 x pow(10, c - 1) - 1)) + 1

    ADAM uses a strict ROUNDS value of 18 because it always uses the 
    maximum double precision value of 15 with the seeds that it 
    generates. I'll let you check the math yourself to prove it :)
