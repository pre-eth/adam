    ROUNDS must satisfy k = T / 3 where T % 3 = 0, where k is 
    the iterations per each chaotic map. 

    To avoid brute force attacks, ROUNDS must also satisfy the 
    condition: pow([5 x pow(10, c - 1) - 1], ROUNDS) > pow(2, 256),
    where c is the number of digits in the seed.

    Note: The paper says that "In any cryptosystem, for poor keys 
    or limited key space K, the cryptosystem can be easily broken. 
    
    Indeed, given todayâ€™s computer speed, it is generally accepted 
    that a key space of size smaller than 2^128."

    However, the paper was written in 2014, and computing power has
    increased even more since then, so instead of 128, 256 is used 
    above as well as the following formula used to calculate K:
      floor(256 / log2(5 x pow(10, c - 1) - 1)) + 1

    The rounds value is supposed to be generated from taking this 
    function 3 times and computing the max, in this case set to 8
    because of the compressed nature of the implementation compared
    to the original implementation
